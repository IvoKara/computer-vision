# Exercise 1 - Computer Vision

## Subtasks

Tasks for exercising and gaining knowladge are the following:

1. Run the sample code to load, render, and store an image - [Example](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/db/deb/tutorial_display_image.html)

2. Run the example code to filter images with smoothing filters - [Example](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/dc/dd3/tutorial_gausian_median_blur_bilateral_filter.html)

3. Run the example code to detect contours with a Sobel operator - [Example](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/d2/d2c/tutorial_sobel_derivatives.html)

4. Run the example code to detect contours with a Laplace operator - [Example](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/d5/db5/tutorial_laplace_operator.html)

5. Run the example code to detect contours with a Kani's method - [Example](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/da/d5c/tutorial_canny_detector.html)

6. Run the sample code to implement a threshold operation - [Example](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/db/d8e/tutorial_threshold.html)

## Main task

Write a program that creates a binary image from an input image by sequentially applying a filter, a differential operator, and a threshold operation of your choice
